# Auto ZMI

Automates the ZMI runecrafting training method.

- Automatically eats, restores stamina, and fills rune pouches without closing the bank.
- Crafts everything it can with the rune pouches, then teleports using the Ourania teleport.
- Restores prayer at the Chaos altar before restarting.
- Supports the [Chin Break Handler](https://github.com/Owain94/OpenOSRS-external-plugins/tree/master/chinbreakhandler).
    - Finishes the current run before breaking.
